DarkOxygen v 0.1

DarkOxygen is color scheme for KDE advanced text editor component featuring a dark background for eye-relaxing coding, based upon Oxygen palette. It has specific improvements for C/C++, Python, PHP/HTML, LaTeX, Matlab/Octave. Other may need tuning.

Installation:
1) Run install.sh script.
 - OR -
1) append:
	- "kateschemarc.darkoxygen" to "~/.kde/share/config/kateschemarc";
	- "katesyntaxhighlightingrc.darkoxygen" to "~/.kde/share/config/katesyntaxhighlightingrc".
(actually the install.sh script does that using cat).
2) Change 'Default schema' of your favorite Qt text editor (kate, kwrite, quanta, kdevelop, etc...) to 'DarkOxygen'.

To do:
- complete syntax highlighting for other languages (let me know if you happen to improve it).
